		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<small><a href="#top">Go to top</a></small><br>
		Covid 19 virus is a SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus which was spread from a animal market in Wuhan,China.<br>
		This virus affects our respiratory system by attacking our lungs and blocking the alveloi with mucus<br>
		The virus is contagious and it can spread through touch and water droplets entering your body through nose or mouth from the infected person<br>
		The virus is fatal and has caused over 6 lakhs fatalities worldwide<br>
		USA is the state with maximu number of cases <br>
		India stands on 3rd postion as far as number of cases are concerned with more than 15 lakhs cases<br>
		It has been declared as a global pandemic by WHO<br>
	</div>
	<div id = "Reason">
		<h3>Why has this virus spread</h3>
		<small><a href="#top">Go to top</a></small><br>
		SARS 2 is said to originate from a bat. Such animal originating viruses which spread in human beings is a consequence of two things:<br>
		<ol>
			<li>Human interference with the animanl habitat</li>
			<li>Carelessness with regard to hygiene</li>
		</ol>
		Many countries also blame China for misguiding about the spread of virus. China's government is accused of revealing about the virus in December end while it has stared spreading from November.<br>
		Also WHO here as a health organization has failed in recognising the pandemic at time.<br> It didn't care to send a team to China to investigate about virus and let it spread worldwide
	</div>

	<div id="Measures">
		<h3>Measures taken:</h3>
		<small><a href="#top">Go to top</a></small><br>
		Many countries after seeing an increase in their corona virus cases imposed a lockdown to stop the virus spread<br>
		But due to this millions of people lost their jobs. Migrants in our country faced problems in going home.<br>
		Economies started shrinking. Though various governments released various relief packages but still the virus is causing gdp to shrink<br>
		US economy has shrinked by 33% - the worst ever GDP decline<br>
		Indian GDP is also expected to shrink by 5% or even more<br>
		<br>
		After some months of lockdown , the procedure of unlocking started.
		<br>People were asked to follow the following norms
		<ul>
			<li>Don't go out of home unless necessary</li>
			<li>Wear proper mask </li>
			<li>Maintain a distance of 2 feet while talking</li>
			<li>Avoid goint to publc gatherings</li>
			<li>Wash you hands or use sanitizer as frequently as possible</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>My Thoughts</h3>
		<small><a href="#top">Go to top</a></small><br>
		This virus has created a situation where the question of survival has become a concern for all of us<br>
		I think earning money is obviously important.You can't just sit home so that you can survive.
		<br>But to deal with this virus follow the norms issued by government<br>
		Try to increase the immunity level of your body
